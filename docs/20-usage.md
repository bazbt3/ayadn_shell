## To run Ayadn using the menu system:

1. Open a Terminal window - best made fullscreen and with a fairly small font size.   
   (Otherwise the display won't be created to match my 'vision.')
2. Type `$ cd ~/Documents`
3. Type `$ ./ayadn_run.sh` to start the wonder off.   
  (Linux novices: don't type the `$` - it's the end of the 'prompt'.)

## Interpreting the windows:

A green status bar at the bottom of the screen shows the window names and indicates which is currently active.

 The window panes are split variously dependent on function:

* Top left at all times is the menu.

* Main:   
  Bottom-left = mentions.   
  Top-right = unread PMs or channel posts.   
  Bottom-right = interactions.

* Mentions:   
  Right = mentions.

* Messages:   
  Right = unread messages/channel posts.

* Timeline:   
  Right = auto-scrolling timeline.

* Channels:   
  Right = channels.

* Multipurpose:   
  Right = a clear command line to allow the user to use the myriad of Ayadn commands not catered for in the menu.   
  (Type `ayadn` for a complete list.)

## The menu:

Finally! The menu is pretty simple:

```
