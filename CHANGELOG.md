# Version 0.4 - 2014-11-16
* Updated the menu display, differentiating between Ayadn and window commands.
* Added `send` and `channels` options.
* Added `Refresh all` option.   
  (Refining the refresh code added in unreleased version 0.3 -this time allowing an exit!)   
  (**Important:** adds an ayadn_refresh.txt file in your ~/Documents folder.)

# Version 0.3 - 2014-11-08
* Added the ability to refresh without exiting and restarting. Unfortunately my lack of code mastery means the script fails to exit without a strategically-timed [ctrl-C].

# Version 0.2 - 2014-11-04
* Hopefully increased the likelihood that the menu will show up for work - by adding `#!/bin/bash` at line 1 of `ayadn_shell.sh`.
* If the menu still fails it might be useful to know that I currently run all (Ubuntu) Terminal window profiles with 'Run command as a login shell' active.
* Thanks @ericdke for the help and @hutattedonmyarm for breaking stuff!

# Version 0.1 - 2014-11-02
* I haven't got a clue about version numbering (or where it's appropriate to create a big 'jump'), so 0.1 as a first release seems appropriate. (I'd thought of 0.000001 due to the overall crapness of my first major Github thing, but given the remote chance of collaboration that'd be silly.)
