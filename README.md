# A Linux Terminal window command line menu for Ayadn

A rudimentary menu system for [Ayadn](https://github.com/ericdke/na), the App.net command line client by [@ericdke](https://github.com/ericdke). My stuff is mainly intended to showcase Ayadn and provide a gentle introduction to Tmux and Tmuxinator.

Treat as very alpha. Actually, treat it as a bit rubbish. Better.

## Want to know more or try this out?

Please take a look at **[the documentation.](https://github.com/bazbt3/ayadn_shell/docs/00-index.md)**

## Disclaimers

* It might appear as if I know what I'm doing. Maybe yes, maybe no. (I blogged about the first couple of sessions [trying to install Ayadn.](http://bazbt3.re-app.net/2014/10/23/command-line/))
* I don't have a Mac thus cannot test on one - however a Mac user *has* got Ayadn_shell to work.
